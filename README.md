SNAKE GAME IN C:-
An interactive console-based Snake Game built using C programming, created to apply theoretical concepts into a practical real-time project.

PROJECT OVERVIEW :-
This project is a classic Snake Game where the player controls the snake using keyboard keys.
The snake grows in length each time it eats food, and the game ends if the snake collides with the wall or with its own body.
This project was developed as a mini project for the C Programming subject to improve logical thinking and hands-on programming skills.

FEATURES:-
1.Real-time keyboard-based movement
2.Growing snake body
3.Random food generation
4.Wall collision detection
5.Self-collision detection
6.Live score display

CONCEPTS USED:-
1.Arrays for storing snake body coordinates
2.Functions for modular programming
3.Loops and conditional statements
4.Random number generation
5.Keyboard handling using getch() and kbhit()
6.Collision detection logic
7.Delay control using Sleep()

CONROALS ACTION:-
Key	Action
w -Move Up
l -	Move Left
d -Move Down
r - Move Right
x -Quit Game
